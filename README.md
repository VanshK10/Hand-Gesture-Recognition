# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
A project that recognizes hand gestures and displays it on a LCD display
The repository consists of two files. The pyhton file does the tasks of capturing image and its classification into various pre-defined gestures using tools like OpenCV, Mediapipe. It also has the code to send the classified hand gesture to the microcontroller.
As of now it is just a basic approach at classification but it can be expanded using deep-learning models and ML.
The second file is the Arduino file which consists of the part of the interpretation of the data sent from the laptop(python file) and taking corresponding action based on it. 
I created this project for the seminar in 3rd year of my engineering and the motivation behind it was to help the specially abled to ease their communication
